                    While I may not be certified in personal training, I still have <strong>years of lifting experience</strong> and can help you achieve your goals.
                    Whether it's powerlifting, or simply wanting to add some muscle onto yourself, I can help! I offer programs I personally use and can assist with your nutrition, too.

                    I have built computers meant for gaming, computers meant for editing, and computers meant for being a workstation.
                    I can also service your current computer, such as opening it up and removing dust, swapping out hardware for upgraded parts, and even tune-up the computer via its operating system with diagnostic methods.
